#Using Databases With Python
##by University of Michigan
##taught by Charles Severance
This course will introduce you to the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort. The course will use SQLite3 as its database. We will also build web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and visualization processes, and will use the D3.js library to do basic data visualization.
